        "# Day 3: Control Structures - Loops\n",
        "\n",
        "Loops are fundamental structures in programming that allow us to execute a block of code repeatedly, under certain conditions. They are essential for automating repetitive tasks, processing collections of data, and building the backbone of algorithms. Understanding loops and how to control them is crucial for writing efficient and effective code.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Why Loop?\n",
        "\n",
        "Loops are necessary for efficient programming as they enable us to avoid repetitive code, making our scripts shorter and more readable. They are particularly valuable when dealing with large datasets or when a task needs to be repeated multiple times under certain conditions. Effective use of loops leads to cleaner, more organized, and more maintainable code.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Collection Data Types\n",
        "\n",
        "- **List Type**: In Python, a list is an ordered collection of items which can be of varied types. Lists are mutable, meaning their elements can be changed after they are created.\n",
